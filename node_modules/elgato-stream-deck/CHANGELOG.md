### Features

* Add example for device detection ([81ad930](https://github.com/lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/commit/81ad930))
* Add function to list available devices ([8c55598](https://github.com/lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/commit/8c55598))
* Add resetToLogo function, ideal for when disconnecting from the device to reset it back to default ([1b94570](https://github.com/lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/commit/1b94570))
* Convert to typescript ([a1492bd](https://github.com/lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/commit/a1492bd))
* Functions to get firmware and serial numbers [#45](https://github.com/lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/issues/45) ([ba130b9](https://github.com/lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/commit/ba130b9))
* Initial (untested) support for StreamDeck Mini ([c41e684](https://github.com/lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/commit/c41e684))
* Port tests to jest and typescript ([4ceaf90](https://github.com/lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/commit/4ceaf90))
* Refactor logic to have a common base class with each device extending it ([8632d93](https://github.com/lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/commit/8632d93))
* Reimplement fillPanel to work solely on buffers. Fix up all the examples ([f35c26c](https://github.com/lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/commit/f35c26c))
* Removed references to sharp (BREAKING CHANGE) ([d17b7c4](https://github.com/lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/commit/d17b7c4))
* Reorder the keys on the original to be left to right. The old behaviour can be restored if desired ([fdff5f1](https://github.com/lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/commit/fdff5f1))
* Use jpeg-turbo as an optional dependency for image encoding, as it is significantly faster than jpeg-js but has a lot more dependencies ([e7e509e](https://github.com/lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/commit/e7e509e))
* Working XL, with slightly dodgey but working image transfer ([eb294e8](https://github.com/lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/commit/eb294e8))



<a name="2.1.1"></a>
## [2.1.1](https://github.com/Lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/compare/v2.1.0...v2.1.1) (2018-04-05)


### Bug Fixes

* **package:** pin node-hid to 0.6.0 ([de5186a](https://github.com/Lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/commit/de5186a)), closes [#46](https://github.com/Lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/issues/46)



<a name="2.1.0"></a>
# [2.1.0](https://github.com/Lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0) (2018-03-05)


### Features

* **package:** eliminate the need for compilation of dependencies on most platforms ([9e5f338](https://github.com/Lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/commit/9e5f338))



<a name="2.0.0"></a>
# [2.0.0](https://github.com/Lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/compare/v1.2.0...v2.0.0) (2017-11-28)

### Features

* add `fillPanel` method
* add `clearAllKeys` method
* return the `StreamDeck` constructor instead of automatically instantiating it
* allow providing a `devicePath` to the constructor
  * if no device path is provided, will attempt to use the first found Stream Deck. Errors if no Stream Decks are connected.
* update `this.keyState` *before* emitting `down` and `up` events
  * this is technically a *breaking change*, but is very unlikely to affect any production code

### Bug Fixes

* fix center-cropping in `fillImageFromFile`
* fix `sharp` only being a `devDependency`, and not a production `dependency`

### Code Refactoring
* refactor `StreamDeck` class to move as much as possible to static methods and static getters
* refactor code to use `async`/`await`
  * this is a *breaking change*, because we now only support Node.js v7.6 or newer

### Documentation

* update all examples
* add `fillPanel` example

### BREAKING CHANGES

* `this.keyState` is now updated **before** `down` and `up` events are emitted.
* Support for versions of Node.js earlier than 7.6 has been dropped.
* The `StreamDeck` constructor is now required when `require`ing this library, instead of an instance of the class.
	* See the docs for updated examples.
